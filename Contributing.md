# How to contribute

We love pull requests. And following this guidelines will make your pull request easier to merge.

## Prerequisites

* If it’s your first pull request, watch [this amazing course](http://makeapullrequest.com/) by [Kent C. Dodds](https://twitter.com/kentcdodds).
* Install [EditorConfig](http://editorconfig.org/) plugin for your code editor to make sure it uses correct settings.
* Fork the repository and clone your fork.
* Install dependencies: `yarn`.

## Development workflow

Run linters and tests:

```bash
yarn test
```

**Please update yarn lock file (`yarn.lock`) if you add or update dependencies.**

## Other notes

* If you have commit access to repository and want to make big change or not sure about something, make a new branch and open pull request.
* We’re using [Prettier](https://github.com/prettier/prettier) to format JavaScript, so don’t worry much about code formatting.
* Don’t commit generated files, like minified JavaScript.
